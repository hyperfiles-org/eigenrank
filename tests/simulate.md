To perform integration testing of your Eigentrust smart contract on the NEAR testnet, especially interacting with another contract like `socialDB` (social.near), you'll use `near-cli`. This command line interface tool allows you to deploy contracts, call contract functions, and manage state changes directly from your terminal. Here are the detailed steps and example commands you'll need:

### Step 1: Installation of NEAR CLI
First, ensure that you have `near-cli` installed. You can install it via npm:
```bash
npm install -g near-cli
```

### Step 2: Setup and Login
Before deploying or testing, ensure you are logged in to your NEAR account on the testnet:
```bash
near login
```
This command will open a web page where you can authorize a NEAR wallet connected to the testnet.

### Step 3: Deploy the Contract
Deploy your compiled WebAssembly (Wasm) contract file to the testnet:
```bash
near deploy --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet --wasmFile path/to/your_contract.wasm
```
Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet` with your testnet account and `path/to/your_contract.wasm` with the path to your compiled contract.

### Step 4: Initialize the Contract
If your contract requires initialization, you can call the init function:
```bash
near call YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet new '{"social_db_contract_id": "social.near"}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet
```
This command initializes your contract with the `socialDB` contract set as `social.near`.

### Step 5: Simulate Interactions
To test interactions with the `socialDB` contract, you might want to simulate fetching interactions and processing them. You would typically have a function to fetch data and another to process it, as specified in your contract.

#### Example Command to Fetch Interactions
Let's assume you have a method `fetch_interactions` that you can call:
```bash
near call YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet fetch_interactions '{"user_id": "user1.testnet"}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet
```
This function would simulate fetching interactions for `user1.testnet`.

#### Example Command to Process Interactions
After fetching, you might process them using another function:
```bash
near call YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet process_interactions '{"data": "simulated_data"}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet
```
Replace `"simulated_data"` with the actual data format your contract expects.

### Step 6: Check Results
To verify the effects of your tests, you may want to query the contract to see the stored results or changes in state:
```bash
near view YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet get_rankings '{"user_id": "user1.testnet"}'
```
This command retrieves any rankings or results associated with `user1.testnet` as stored by your contract.

### Step 7: Stress Testing
To perform stress testing, you might want to automate these calls using a script or manually execute them in rapid succession:
```bash
for i in {1..10}
do
   near call YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet process_interactions '{"data": "simulated_data_'$i'"}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet
done
```
This loop sends 10 transactions quickly to simulate load.

### Step 8: Clean Up
After testing, if needed, you can reset or clear the contract state with a cleanup function:
```bash
near call YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet reset_state '{}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.testnet
```

### Final Notes
- Ensure you have enough NEAR tokens in your testnet account to cover the transaction and storage fees.
- Adjust the commands based on your actual contract method names and expected parameters.
- Continuously monitor transaction results and logs for any errors or unexpected behaviors.

This approach should give you a comprehensive method to test your NEAR contract's interaction with `socialDB` and help ensure it functions correctly before moving to a production environment.
